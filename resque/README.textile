h1. Resque Chef Cookbook using Bluepill

There's only resque_config definition that you need to check out.

It assumes that @RAILS_ENV@, @RACK_ENV@ or @APP_ENV@ are already set in your user environment.

h2. Deploying

Defaults to a Capistrano project structure.

@after_restart.rb@ goes into your @deploy/after_restart.rb@

That should be it!
