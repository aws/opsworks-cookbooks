# This is the place to override the rails cookbook's default attributes.
#
# Do not edit THIS file directly. Instead, create
# "rails/attributes/customize.rb" in your cookbook repository and
# put the overrides in YOUR customize.rb file.
###

# The following shows how to override the Rails version used:
#
#normal[:rails][:version] = "2.3.18"

normal[:logrotate][:size] = "10M"
normal[:logrotate][:frequency] = "hourly"
