# This is a configuration template for the New Relic daemon - a communications
# proxy between New Relic agents (such as the PHP agent) and the New Relic
# data collectors. This configuration file is required *ONLY* if you need or
# want to start the New Relic daemon at system boot time using init. In order
# to do so you must execute the following commands (as root):
#
# For CentOS and RedHat systems:
#    /sbin/chkconfig newrelic-daemon on
#
# For Ubuntu and Debian systems:
#    /usr/sbin/update-rc.d newrelic-daemon defaults 90 10
#    /usr/sbin/update-rc.d newrelic-daemon enable
#
# For other systems please consult your documentation on how to enable and
# disable services.
#
# For all systems:
#    /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon start
#
# The startup scripts will only start the daemon if there is a valid daemon
# configuration file in place. This file is, by default:
#
#    /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg
#
# If that file does not exist, you can copy this template file to that
# location and edit it to suit your system needs.
#
# By default the daemon is not started at system boot time, and does not use
# the /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg file. Rather, the daemon is started by the
# agent automatically on startup and is configured by the agent (for example
# when using the PHP agent the daemon parameters are set in the global INI
# file and all begin with 'newrelic.daemon').
#
# There are certain circumstances under which you may want the daemon to be
# started at boot time rather than by the agent. If you use a chroot jail for
# running the agent in, if you have multiple web servers or FastCGI process
# managers, or if you use PHP on the command line a lot for batch processing
# then you may want to start the daemon once at system boot rather than having
# the agent start it.
#
# Below are the various options you can change that affect the daemon. Each
# one is explained in detail along with it's default value.
#

#
# Setting: pidfile
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the name of the file that the daemon writes its process ID
#          (PID) to. This is used by the startup and shutdown script to know
#          which process to monitor or kill.
# Default: OS-dependent. Uses a filename of newrelic-daemon.pid in the first
#          directory from the list /var/run or /var/pid that is found.
<% if @resource.daemon_pidfile.nil? %>
#pidfile=/var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid
<% else %>
pidfile=<%= @resource.daemon_pidfile %>
<% end %>

#
# Setting: logfile
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the name of the file to record log messages in. If this file
#          does not exist it is created. If it cannot be created the daemon
#          will not start up. The amount of information sent to this file is
#          controlled by the loglevel settings, defined below.
# Default: /var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log
<% if @resource.daemon_logfile.nil? %>
#logfile=/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log
<% else %>
logfile=<%= @resource.daemon_logfile %>
<% end %>

#
# Setting: loglevel
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the level of detail of log messages sent to the log file. This
#          variable can control the log level for different subsystem at
#          different levels, although such custom usage should only be done at
#          the request of New Relic technical support. The simplest setting is
#          to use one of the following keywords, in increasing order of detail:
#          error - only error messages
#          warning - only warning and error messages
#          info - only minimal startup and shutdown info
#          verbose - slightly more verbose than info, not commonly used
#          debug - very verbose, includes messages only relevant to support
#          verbosedebug - extremely verbose, creates massive log files
# Default: info
<% if @resource.daemon_loglevel.nil? %>
#loglevel=info
<% else %>
loglevel=<%= @resource.daemon_loglevel %>
<% end %>

#
# Setting: port
# Type   : Integer (1-65534)
# Purpose: Sets the TCP port on which the daemon will listen for connections
#          from agents (agents in this case includes Apache / php-fpm worker
#          processes, the command line, or any other agent source). In order
#          to use a port in the range 1-1023, the daemon must be started by
#          the super-user. This is a fundamental OS limitation and not one
#          imposed by the daemon itself.
# Default: 33142
<% if @resource.daemon_port.nil? %>
#port=33142
<% else %>
port=<%= @resource.daemon_port %>
<% end %>

#
# Setting: ssl
# Type   : boolean
# Purpose: If you prefer the daemon to use the secure HTTP (https) protocol
#          when communicating with the New Relic collector servers, set this
#          to true. Please note that in order for this to work the daemon must
#          be able to find a Certificate Authority (CA) list. On startup the
#          daemon will attempt to find such a list in the usual places, but
#          you may need to use the ssl_ca_bundle or ssl_ca_path variables
#          below.
# Default: false
<% if @resource.daemon_ssl.nil? %>
#ssl=false
<% else %>
ssl=<%= @resource.daemon_ssl %>
<% end %>

#
# Setting: proxy
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Some networks are configured to require the use of an egress proxy
#          server in order to communicate with the outside world. Since the
#          daemon needs to communicate with the New Relic data collection
#          servers you may need to instruct it to use a proxy server. Your
#          system or network administrator should be able to provide you with
#          the details.
#          This string is in the form [user[:password]]@hostname[:port] with
#          the user, password and port fields being optional. Some examples:
#          myusername:secret@10.1.1.1:12345
#          someuser@proxy.mydomain.com:4321
#          proxy.mydomain.com
# Default: none
<% if @resource.daemon_proxy.nil? %>
#proxy=
<% else %>
proxy=<%= @resource.daemon_proxy %>
<% end %>

#
# Setting: ssl_ca_bundle
# Type   : string
# Purpose: If you have the "ssl" option above enabled, and the daemon cannot
#          find a suitable Certificate Authority (CA) list, this is one of the
#          options you can use to point it to the CA list to use. If your SSL
#          installation uses a "bundle" - i.e. a single file which contains a
#          list of CA's - then this option should point to that bundle file.
# Default: Looks for one of two files: /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt or
#          /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.
#
<% if @resource.daemon_ssl_ca_bundle.nil? %>
#ssl_ca_bundle=
<% else %>
ssl_ca_bundle=<%= @resource.daemon_ssl_ca_bundle %>
<% end %>

#
# Setting: ssl_ca_path
# Type   : string
# Purpose: See ssl_ca_bundle above. This option should be used if your SSL
#          installation uses a sub-directory with a list of CA certificates.
#          Set this variable to point to that directory.
# Default: /etc/ssl/certs
<% if @resource.daemon_ssl_ca_path.nil? %>
#ssl_ca_path=
<% else %>
ssl_ca_path=<%= @resource.daemon_ssl_ca_path %>
<% end %>

#
# Setting: max_threads
# Type   : integer (4-128)
# Purpose: Internally the daemon uses a "pool" of worker threads to deal with
#          activity from each connected agent. In certain very busy setups
#          you may need to increase this number in order to service all of
#          those connections quickly enough. Each extra thread you create does
#          have resource usage (memory, CPU etc.) implications so do not just
#          increase this arbitrarily.
# Default: 8
<% if @resource.daemon_max_threads.nil? %>
#max_threads=8
<% else %>
max_threads=<%= @resource.daemon_max_threads %>
<% end %>

#
# Setting: collector_host
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the host name of the New Relic data collector host to use.
#          Please note that this is NOT any form of local host. It refers to
#          the New Relic provided host. There is very little reason to ever
#          change this from the default except in certain very special
#          circumstances, and then only on instruction from a New Relic sales
#          person or support staff member.
# Default: collector.newrelic.com
<% if @resource.daemon_collector_host.nil? %>
#collector_host=collector.newrelic.com
<% else %>
collector_host=<%= @resource.daemon_collector_host %>
<% end %>
