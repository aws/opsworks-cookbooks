opsworks-cookbooks
==================

These are the standard Chef cookbooks used by AWS OpsWorks.

If you want to override any template (like the Rails database.yml or the Apache vhost definition),
this is the place to look for the originals.

The branches are organized as follows and depend on the
[configuration manager](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStack.html)
used by your stack.

- Chef 11.4
  - [release-chef-11.4](https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/tree/release-chef-11.4): Cookbooks for the current release.
  - [master-chef-11.4](https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/tree/master-chef-11.4): Cookbooks for the next release.
- Chef 0.9
  - [release-chef-0.9](https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/tree/release-chef-0.9): Cookbooks for the current release.
  - [master-chef-0.9](https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/tree/master-chef-0.9): Cookbooks for the next release.

The `master` branch is no longer used since AWS OpsWorks supports
multiple configuration managers now.
