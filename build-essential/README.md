[travis]: http://travis-ci.org/opscode-cookbooks/build-essential

Installs packages required for compiling C software from source. Use this
cookbook if you wish to compile C programs, or install RubyGems with native
extensions.

Requirements
------------
Chef 11+ and Ohai 6.14+ are required. For the latest list of supported
platforms, please see the `metadata.rb`.

**Note for Debian platform family:** On Debian platform-family systems, it is recommended that `apt-get update` be run, to ensure that the package cache is updated. It's not in the scope of this cookbook to do that, as it can [create a duplicate resource](https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3694). We recommend using the [apt](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/apt) cookbook to do this.

**Note for OmniOS**: Currently, OmniOS's Ruby package is built with
GCC 4.6.3, and the path is hardcoded, as the gcc binaries are not
installed in the default $PATH. This means that in order to install
RubyGems into the "system" Ruby, one must install `developer/gcc46`.
[An issue](https://github.com/omniti-labs/omnios-build/issues/19) is
open upstream w/ OmniOS to rebuild the Ruby package with GCC 4.7.2.

Attributes
----------
| Attribute      | Default | Description                       |
|----------------|:-------:|-----------------------------------|
| `compile_time` | `false` | Execute resources at compile time |


Usage
-----
Include the build-essential recipe in your run list:

```sh
knife node run_list add NODE "recipe[build-essential::default]"
```

or add the build-essential recipe as a dependency and include it from inside
another cookbook:

```ruby
include_recipe 'build-essential::default'
```

### Gems with C extensions
For RubyGems that include native C extensions you wish to use with Chef, you
should do the following.

1. Set the `compile_time` attribute to true in your wrapper cookbook or role:

    ```ruby
    # Wrapper attribute
    default['build-essential']['compile_time'] = true
    ```

    ```ruby
    # Role
    default_attributes(
      'build-essential' => {
        'compile_time' => true
      }
    )
    ```

1. Ensure that the C libraries, which include files and other assorted "dev"
type packages, are installed in the compile phase after the build-essential
recipe is executed. For example:

    ```ruby
    include_recipe 'build-essential::default'

    package('mypackage-devel') { action :nothing }.run_action(:install)
    ```

1. Use the `chef_gem` resource in your recipe to install the gem with the native
extension:

    ```ruby
    chef_gem 'gem-with-native-extension'
    ```
