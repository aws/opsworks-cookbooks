  Chef::Log.warn <<-EOH
A build-essential recipe does not exist for '#{node['platform_family']}'. This
means the build-essential cookbook does not have support for the
#{node['platform_family']} family. If you are not compiling gems with native
extensions or building packages from source, this will likely not affect you.
